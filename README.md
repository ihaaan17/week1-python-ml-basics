# Week 1: Python & ML Basics 🚀

This repository tracks my progress as I dive into the foundations of Machine Learning. 

## 🧠 What I Learned day 1: NumPy Quickstart
In the first part of this week, I explored **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Key concepts covered:

* **ndarray:** Understanding the powerful N-dimensional array object.
* **Array Creation:** Using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, and `np.arange`.
* **Basic Operations:** Element-wise arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
* **Universal Functions:** Using methods like `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()` across axes.
* **Indexing & Slicing:** Extracting specific data from one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

## 🛠️ Setup
I am running my development environment using **Docker** to ensure reproducibility:
- **Image:** `jupyter/scipy-notebook`
- **IDE:** VS Code connected to a remote Jupyter server.
